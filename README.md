I am a marketing major with over 5 years of data experience in multiple markets. 
I want to use my deep knowledge of data analysis and marketing to solve problems and offer key insights. 
I also have a strong background in sales, which gives me the ability to confidently present data driven solutions in a direct and effective manner.
